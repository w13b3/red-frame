# red-frameâ€‡ <sub><sup>_Website framework for redbean_<sup><sub>

### For what is _red-frame_
One of the coolest programs of the [Cosmopolitan] project is [Redbean].  
Redbean is a single-file distributable web server.  
It uses [Lua] for its dynamic serving language.  
Websites can be made with it by adding HTML files to the zip or serving directory.

### What is red-frame
Red-frame is another website framework for redbean.  
With red-frame it is possible to define web-pages/applications.

### Why another website framework
It started as a personal learning project.  
And it ended as something useful.

The other frameworks are single-file and multipurpose.  
The aim of red-frame is not to be a single-file for every purpose.  
It is basic, tested and it can be extended to by other modules.

### Is red-frame replacing the `Route` function of Redbean?
No. red-frame is an extension.  
Even with red-frame added to the zip, requests can be made still for the files in the zip or the local directory.  
Therefor `Route` should be the fallback if the `Frame:RoutePath` function of red-frame fails.
